## Overview

Sea level rise is one of the most significant indicators of long-term climate change. Understanding historical sea-level variability provides valuable insight into coastal dynamics, climate variability, and future environmental risks.

This project performs a comprehensive **time-series analysis** of monthly sea-level observations recorded at **Mumbai (Apollo Bandar), India**, between **1878 and 1961** using statistical and forecasting techniques in **R**.

The workflow includes data preprocessing, visualization, decomposition, trend analysis, forecasting, and residual diagnostics to understand historical sea-level behavior and evaluate predictive performance.
